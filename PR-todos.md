- [x] rename yaml files for forget
- [x] update metrics and memorization files to fit new names
- [ ] Implement metric aggregator for every metric {"overall":0.5, "details": {"index_to_probs": {}}}
- [ ] create yaml files for other splits standard prob and rouge metrics
- [ ] write truth ratio for other splits
- [ ] remove truth ratio dependence on paraphrased (access key)
        paraphrased -> true 
        perturbed -> false
- [ ] Implement averaging logic for different datasets in Truth Ratio
